# weather-webhook

This is a small project I made and fjsdkfhlkdsh im too lazy to write this readme.md
uhh

clone the repository, cd into it, pip install -r requirements.txt

then in .env change the placeholder to your discord webhook link and openweather api link (note: this script was built with the OpenWeatherMap Current Weather API in mind so dont use any other API. also use latitude and longitude of your location, or it's ID or ISO 3166 compliant name. remember to put your API key as well or else you'll get error 401 (invalid authentication).
